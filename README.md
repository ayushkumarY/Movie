<h1>Movie</h1>
<p>I created a website using React and Tailwind CSS. The site displays various movies that are fetched through an API. On the website, I added a table button that displays movies in a table format using react-data-table-component. Additionally, I included a filter button that opens a tab with two fields to filter movies by year and type. On the home page, there is also a search field where you can search for movies by name. Finally, I added a sign-in and login tab that includes validation through Formik and Yup.</p>
