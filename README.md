<h1>Movie</h1>
<p>I have developed this website using React and Tailwind CSS.The various movies that are visible are fetched through an API.Then i have given a table button that shows movies in the form of table using react-data-table-component.Then i have given an Filter button that pops up a tab in which 2 fields are there that can filter movies based on year and type, also on the home page there is a search field where you can search movie with there Names.Next there is sign in and login tab also given with validation through Formik and Yup.</p>
